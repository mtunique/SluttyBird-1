This is a game I developed in the winter of 2014 with my teammates 'MT'
Actually this is also the first try in computer vision by learning the openCV and made a small program...BTW,I'm in charge for the scanning part
It contains a file that was found in the internet supporting as the cameraDS


Anyway, take this first project as my college_first_try  >_<
